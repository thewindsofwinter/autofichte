To take away our right to carry on our business, and to cancel the right conferred upon us by law, is against our fundamental moral convictions—in other words, it is against our faith in the independence and morality of our fellowmen. What is to be done? He who does not respect the law will not respect himself.

If he, therefore, will not respect me, it is impossible that he will respect himself. But perhaps he will, and will respect me, which I must respect.

It is indeed clear enough that we could not make ourselves free; and this is even apparent to us merely by looking upon our free state as our final end. To be free is a condition of free acts; and as this condition is this, this, and this, the condition of that free act becomes clear to us. It means to give something up; to give up a thing immediately, and not wait for another one—of course, not waiting for a result.

The problem here is this, whether the state permits something to be taken away from me or not. But we can not say what constitutes a thing in our language; for, if we can not say something, we are missing something.

There is no reason why each person should have the right to transfer this thing away, and the state should be obliged to protect this right of compulsion. The same right of compulsion which one uses to compel another person to let off his rights of property becomes applicable to a thing which the other person has transferred.

The problem might be thus solved: each person will have the right to restrict the use of property of persons he has recognized. The right must be limited by the use and transfer of that property; that is, the right to transfer the possession of that property, which the other recognizes to be property, can not be arbitrarily extended until that property has been transferred.

I have a right to use my own property for personal purposes. I have not a right to transfer that property; it is mine only property; it is no use to me to use it for this purpose. For the one is my own; and the other is every property of the one. In that case the private owner of the land holds a right to take possession of that land and hold my rights as the proprietor of that land for future use. Each of my rights is an express security (as we shall prove hereafter) conferred by the other.

Now, it is clear that I would like my rights of property restricted and limited only by the use, transfer or possession of that property, if that possession was so assigned. By that title I claim the right to acquire a certain property, and I give myself up my rights of property to the other.

That title is called by the law of transfer; for it belongs to the common sovereign of the one land. I have a right to transfer it to him, if I transfer the right to do so and the title; in other words, he may transfer the title to mine. But he can transfer his claim to the title only until he finds me not to transfer it.

As for the title to the land adjoining mine, the ground of the title is a private property held by me. I am a natural person of land. If the property had not been mine, the title would not have been mine, and the law of transfer would have been a legal tie.

Let the subject of this treaty, the French, speak of me as the proprietor of mine land. For the French never treat me as subject to mine; for they speak and read like their own language:

PREFACE.

Our sources of knowledge are limited by our faith; by our science of language; with that which I have heretofore been established, and which we have long been taught—the principles of reason. Our investigations were founded upon false perceptions, of which the subject can only be apprehended through the possibility of a certainty; and what is impossible can not be apprehended.

What I have to say in reference to you, brothers, and sisters, is the purest and most pure work of philosophy; that is, of science. To it is pointed the fundamental principle of our science of minds. We call it the Principle of Reason.

PREFUSE.


The freedom of the subject is conditioned by his own determination; and this determination is called freedom of the individual; the freedom of the individual is the freedom restricted by his own determination, freedom according to the law of property; the individual is therefore either free or subject. It can not be posited as a science which is not based upon the pure conception of reason. It can not be proved whether I, in respect to my whole personality, have determined my freedom according to the conceptions of my rational beings; for I have not determined it. Only the rational being which, in this respect, is me, or has determined my freedom for me, can be called free,
